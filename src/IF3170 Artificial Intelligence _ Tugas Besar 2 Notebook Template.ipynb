Feature Scaling\n","\n","**Feature scaling** is a preprocessing technique used in machine learning to standardize the range of independent variables or features of data.

If the scales of features are significantly different, some algorithms may perform poorly or take much longer to converge.\n","\n","2. **Distance-Based Algorithms:** Algorithms that rely on distances or similarities between data points, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and support vector machines (SVM), can be influenced by feature scales. Features with larger scales may dominate the distance calculations.\n","\n","3. **Regularization:** Regularization techniques, like L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization, add penalty terms based on feature coefficients. Scaling ensures that all features are treated equally in the regularization process.\n","\n","Common methods for feature scaling include:\n","\n","1. **Min-Max Scaling (Normalization):** This method scales features to a specific range, typically [0, 1].
